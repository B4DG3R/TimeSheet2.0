# TimeSheet2.0
Time Sheet is an iOS app built to do my work time sheet on.  The app allows you add jobs one at a time to a list, save each the job, and then export the job list in csv format via email.  You can then clear the list at the end of the week and start a fresh time sheet.

## Motivation
This app was built to basically solve the problem of me doing a paper time sheet at work.  I didn't want to keep filling out my time sheet on paper, so i built an app to do it on my phone.  So no more paper, and it makes my time sheet more accurate as i fill it in as soon as ive finished a job.   This is version 2.0 of the App.  Better more user friendly UI.

## Build status
This is version 2.0 of the project.  It's ready for day to day testing as of the 17/08/2020.

## Code style
It partially conforms to MVC.  As I refactor it will more and more  but for now i just wanted to get an MVP.
